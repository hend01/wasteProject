# Waste Project

## Overview

This project was created using Create React App (CRA) to manage and display waste-related data.

## What I Modified

- Converted the original card-based layout into a **list view** for easier scanning.
- Added **pagination** to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Implemented a **drawer** component that opens when selecting an item to show detailed information.
- Improved user experience with better navigation and component organization.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hend01/wasteProject.git
   cd wasteProject
